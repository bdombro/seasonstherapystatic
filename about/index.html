                  At Seasons Therapy, the seasons of your life are honored and
                  help is given to handle the transitions. Whether you’re facing
                  a problem with your job, a relationship that is unhealthy, a
                  worry about your child at any age, an illness that is
                  impairing your abilities, or a concern for yourself or another
                  that a habit has gotten out of control, behavioral health
                  treatment has helped many people get back on track. Having
                  problems with depression, anxiety or other mental health
                  issues can make these struggles much more difficult, so
                  learning ways to manage these becomes part of the process of
                  recovery. I have been in practice as a counselor for over 20
                  years and feel that at this stage of my life I have seen many
                  seasons and have the experience to guide you through the
                  storm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a Social Worker, I have been a part of people’s lives in
                  many ways. Early in my career as a Crisis Clinician I fought
                  for them when they experienced a crisis in emergency rooms and
                  treatment centers. Later I joined them in their homes to help
                  them solve problems that seemed insurmountable. I facilitated
                  group therapy, taught classes, advocated, confronted and
                  looked holistically at the person and family within
                  complicated circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As a Certified Addictions Counselor, I have worked extensively
                  with people who are dealing with the challenge of substance
                  use disorders, compulsions, dual diagnosis and the losses that
                  come with it. I have cried with parents, and rejoiced with
                  clients who achieved milestones in recovery. These experiences
                  have transformed my life and given me a profound respect for
                  each person’s individual journey, while confirming that there
                  is a universality of experience that allows us to learn from
                  the wisdom of the ages.

                  I use Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to help clients discover
                  nonproductive patterns and learn how to navigate the road
                  toward acceptance, love, awareness, forgiveness and recovery.
                  I also incorporate concepts of Mindfulness, Behavioral,
                  Motivational, Reality, Pastoral and Brief Solution Focused
                  Therapy. This eclectic approach helps me to meet your needs as
                  you present them. I work with you to facilitate your personal
                  and spiritual growth, believing that it is a lifelong journey
                  that enables us to appreciate the mountaintop experiences, and
                  to cope with the valleys.

                  I am passionate about recovery and have supported many causes
                  to help people rehabilitate from losses and setbacks of all
                  types. Life isn’t just about surviving though, it is about
                  experiencing the fullness of a life well lived. I hope you
                  decide to pursue therapy with me and allow me to be a part of
                  your journey.

                    >My Declaration of Self Esteem: I am me. In all the world
                    there is no one else exactly like me. Everything that comes
                    out of me is authentically mine, because I alone choose it–I
                    own everything me: my body, my feelings, my mouth, my voice,
                    all my actions, whether they be to others or myself. I own
                    my fantasies, my dreams, my hopes, my fears. I own my
                    triumphs and successes, all my failures and mistakes.
                    Because I own all of me, I can become intimately acquainted
                    with me. By so doing, I can love me and be friendly with all
                    my parts. I know there are aspects about myself that puzzle
                    me, and other aspects that I do not know, but as long as I
                    am friendly and loving to myself, I can courageously and
                    hopefully look for solutions to the puzzles and ways to find
                    out more about me. However I look and sound, whatever I say
                    and do, and whatever I think and feel at a given moment in
                    time is authentically me. If later some parts of how I
                    looked, sounded, thought, and felt turn out to be unfitting,
                    I can discard that which is unfitting, keep the rest, and
                    invent something new for that which I discarded. I can see,
                    hear, feel, think, say, and do. I have the tools to survive,
                    to be close to others, to be productive, and to make sense
                    and order out of the world of people and things outside of
                    me. I own me, and therefore, I can engineer me. I am me, and
                    I am OK.  –</em
